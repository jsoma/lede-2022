# Lede 2022

## What should I be doing?

It's the beginning, so you're probably interested in [setting things up](setup/intro.md).

## Prep work

* [Python's Not (Just) For Unicorns](http://littlecolumns.com/learn/python), a tutorial on Python
* [Terminus](https://web.mit.edu/mprat/Public/web/Terminus/Web/main.html), a game to teach you the command line
* [Lazy Basics of HTML and CSS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO_it0hy0hg&list=PLewNEVDy7gq1vO4fTJe5fJw4u63qiKt0o&index=1), an awful tutorial about building for the web
