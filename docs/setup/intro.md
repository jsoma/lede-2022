# Introduction

One of the most difficult things about getting started with programming and data analysis is **setting up your computer**.

Computer setup is also one of the parts where you learn the most about how your computer works, so think of it more as a **learning experience** (with appropriate amounts of struggle) instead of simple preparation.

What kind of system do you have?

=== ":fontawesome-brands-apple: OS X"

    **Do you have an M1 machine?** You can check by clicking the apple icon :fontawesome-brands-apple: in the upper-left corner of your screen, and then selecting **About This Mac**. If it says "M1" anywhere in there, you have an M1.
    
    M1 macs are newer, faster, sleeker, and *prone to installation problems.* We'll work through them, though!

=== ":fontawesome-brands-windows: Windows"

    Find other people who use Windows!
    
    Windows is a lot more flexible of a system, sold by many different people and places, and is build to support a lot of older pieces of software. As a result, there's a much winder range of settings on a Windows machine as compared to a Mac.
    
    With so many settings, you might run into issues that aren't covered in this guide! Leaning on other Windows folks to help think through problems is a great approach.
