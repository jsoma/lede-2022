# Setting up Visual Studio Code

## Installing recommended software

Any time VS Code helpfully suggests that it can install something â€“ Python support, a linter, extensions to help you with such-and-such filetype, just agree! It's probably giving you good advice.

## CAN YOU TRUST THIS FOLDER?

VS Code likes to ask if you can trust the files you're opening. Yes,you can!

If you get irritated that it keeps asking again and again and again, we can completely disable the prompt:

1. Search in settings for `trust`.
2. Under **Security > Workspace > Trust**, make sure "Controls whether or not workspace trust is enabled within VS Code" is **unchecked**.

## Disable autocomplete on enter

Sometimes VS Code tries to be a little too helpful in suggesting code to you. This turns that off.

1. Search in settings for `enter`.
2. Set **Editor: Accept Suggestions on Enter** to **off**.

## Set tabs as spaces

This one should already be set up, but we can make sure.

1. Search for `tab space`.
2. Make sure **Editor: Insert Spaces** is checked.
