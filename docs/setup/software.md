# Software to install

## Visual Studio Code

First you'll want to download [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), a "plain text editor." A plain text editor is used to reading and writing documents that don't have any formatting - no bold, no colors, no font choice. Just you and the text!

Once you've downloaded Visual Studio Code, you'll want to [vs-code.md](set it up).

## Slack

You'll probably want to download [Slack](https://slack.com/). Here are links for [Windows](https://slack.com/downloads/windows) and [Mac](https://slack.com/downloads/mac).

Once you've got set up, you might want to check out a little [Slack how-to guide](https://slack.com/help/articles/360059928654-How-to-use-Slack--your-quick-start-guide) to become familiar with how it works.
