# Opening the command line

The **command line** has many names and types: terminal, shell, CLI, command prompt, bash, zsh... the list goes on and one.

You don't need to know any of that to open it, though.

=== ":fontawesome-brands-apple: OS X"

    Click the maginifying class in the upper-right corner of your computer, and search for **Terminal**. Run it.

=== ":fontawesome-brands-windows: Windows"

    Click the start menu, search for **Cmder**, and run it. If you don't have it, [install it](../setup/cmder.md).

    !!! warning

        To make things confusing, there are like sixty different command lines on Windows, including PowerShell and the Command Prompt. You should use Cmder, though, because it uses the normal/common/typical commands you'll see all over the internet.

Welcome to the command line!
